Typing "make" will start the process of compiling all the data and averages to plot the data for the focus of my project (big snow days only).
The results from my data will be placed in a file called snowPlot.pdf. Typing "make clean" will remove all necessary files to re-run my programs
from the beginning.

I have included PDFs of all the data, negligible snowfall data, low snowfall data, medium snowfall data, and high snowfall data. When comparing snowPlot.pdf and snowPlot_high.pdf, the colors may be slightly different due to randomization of color choices.
