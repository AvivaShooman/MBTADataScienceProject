# MBTADataScienceProject
MBTA Data Science project for Linux course Fall 2018. I analyzed the socioeconomic effects of snowfall on the MBTA ridership during 2016 and 2017 using various MBTA and snowfall data sets. My results confirmed that with any amount of snow the overall MBTA ridership decreases and that the largest number of stations with a decrease in ridership centered around the middle class (middle income, for a large snowstorm). From my data, I can conclude that generally the more income you make (once you reach about $55,000), the less likely you are to ride the MBTA during a big snow storm. More comprehensive analysis in SemesterProjectSummary.txt.

Typing "make" will start the process of compiling all the data and averages to plot the data for the focus of my project (big snow days only). The results from my data will be placed in a file called snowPlot.pdf. Typing "make clean" will remove all necessary files to re-run my programs from the beginning.

I have included PDFs of all the data, negligible snowfall data, low snowfall data, medium snowfall data, and high snowfall data. When comparing snowPlot.pdf and snowPlot_high.pdf, the colors may be slightly different due to the randomization of color choices.
